Exercise 3: Customizing plots - What's wrong 2?

Take a look at the following two plots. They show the same information: rates of measles by state in the United States
 for 1928.
Instructions

Possible Answers

    Both plots provide the same information, so they are equally good.
    The plot on the left is better because it orders the states alphabetically.
    The plot on the right is better because it orders the states by disease rate so we can quickly see the states with

    Both plots should be pie charts instead


ANSWER:
 The plot on the right is better because it orders the states by disease rate so we can quickly see the states with 
highest and lowest rates.
