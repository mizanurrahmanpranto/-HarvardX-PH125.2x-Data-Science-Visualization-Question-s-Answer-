Titanic Survival Exercises

Put all your new skills together to perform exploratory data analysis on a classic machine learning dataset: 
Titanic survival!
Background

The Titanic was a British ocean liner that struck an iceberg and sunk on its maiden voyage in 1912 from the 
United Kingdom to New York. More than 1,500 of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew died in the accident,
 making this one of the largest maritime disasters ever outside of war. The ship carried a wide range of 
passengers of all ages and both genders, from luxury travelers in first-class to immigrants in the lower 
classes. However, not all passengers were equally likely to survive the accident. We use real data about a 
selection of 891 passengers to learn who was on the Titanic and which passengers were more likely to survive.
Libraries, Options, and Data 

Be sure that you have installed the titanic package before proceeding.

Define the titanic dataset starting from the titanic library with the following code:

options(digits = 3)    # report 3 significant digits
library(tidyverse)
library(titanic)

titanic <- titanic_train %>%
    select(Survived, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare) %>%
    mutate(Survived = factor(Survived),
           Pclass = factor(Pclass),
           Sex = factor(Sex))

Question 1: Variable Types


Inspect the data and also use ?titanic_train to learn more about the variables in the dataset. Match these variables 
from the dataset to their variable type. There is at least one variable of each type (ordinal categorical, non-ordinal
 categorical, continuous, discrete).


Survived =>non-ordinal categorical

Pclass  =>ordinal categorical

Sex  =>non-ordinal categorical

SibSp  =>discrete

Parch  =>discrete

Fare =>continuous


 Question 2: Demographics of Titanic Passengers


Make density plots of age grouped by sex. Try experimenting with combinations of faceting, alpha blending, stacking and 
using variable counts on the y-axis to answer the following questions. Some questions may be easier to answer with 
different versions of the density plot.
Which of the following are true?

Select all correct answers.
1.Females and males had the same general shape of age distribution. correct
2.The age distribution was bimodal, with one mode around 25 years of age and a second smaller mode around 5 years of age. correct
3.There were more females than males.
4The count of males of age 40 was higher than the count of females of age 40. correct
5.The proportion of males age 18-35 was higher than the proportion of females age 18-35. correct
6.The proportion of females under age 17 was higher than the proportion of males under age 17. correct
7.The oldest passengers were female.


Answer Code and Explanation

A faceted plot is useful for comparing the distributions of males and females for A. Each sex has the same general shape
 with two modes at the same locations, though proportions differ slightly across ages and there are more males than
 females.

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2) +
    facet_grid(Sex ~ .)

A stacked density plot with count on the y-axis is useful for answering B, C and D. The main mode is around age 25 and 
a second smaller mode is around age 4-5. There are more males than females as indicated by a higher total area and higher
 counts at almost all ages. With count on the y-axis, it is clear that more males than females are age 40.

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, y = ..count.., fill = Sex)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2, position = "stack")

A plot filled by sex with alpha blending helps reveal the answers to E, F and G. There is a higher proportion of females
 than males below age 17, a higher proportion of males than females for ages 18-35, approximately the same proportion of
 males and females age 35-55, and a higher proportion of males over age 55. The oldest individuals are male.

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2)


 Question 3: QQ-plot of Age Distribution


Use geom_qq() to make a QQ-plot of passenger age and add an identity line with geom_abline(). Filter out any individuals
 with an age of NA first. Use the following object as the dparams argument in geom_qq():

params <- titanic %>%
    filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%
    summarize(mean = mean(Age), sd = sd(Age))



Answer Code

titanic %>%
    filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(sample = Age)) +
    geom_qq(dparams = params) +
    geom_abline()



Answer Code

titanic %>%
    filter(!is.na(Age)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(sample = Age)) +
    geom_qq(dparams = params) +
    geom_abline()



 Question 4: Survival by Sex


To answer the following questions, make barplots of the Survived and Sex variables using geom_bar(). Try plotting one variable and filling by the other variable. You may want to try the default plot, then try adding position = position_dodge() to geom_bar() to make separate bars for each group.

You can read more about making barplots in the textbook section on ggplot2 geometries.
Which of the following are true?

Select all correct answers.
1.Less than half of passengers survived.
2.Most of the survivors were female.
3.Most of the males survived.
4.Most of the females survived.


Explanation and Answer Code

A and B can be clearly seen in the barplot of survival status filled by sex. The count of survivors is lower than the 
count of non-survivors. The bar of survivors is more than half filled by females. Alternatively, the bars can be split 
by sex with position_dodge, showing the "Female, Survived" bar has a greater height than the "Male, survived" bar. C 
and D are more clearly seen in the barplot of sex filled by survival status, though they can also be determined from 
the first barplot. Most males did not survive, but most females did survive.

#plot 1 - survival filled by sex
titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Survived, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_bar()
# plot 2 - survival filled by sex with position_dodge
titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Survived, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge())
#plot 3 - sex filled by survival
titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Sex, fill = Survived)) +
    geom_bar()



 Question 5: Survival by Age

0-8
10-18
18-30
30-50
50-70
70-80
correct => 18-30
Which age group had the highest proportion of deaths?
0-8
10-18
18-30
30-50
50-70
70-80
correct =>70-80

Answer Code

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, y = ..count.., fill = Survived)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.2)


 Question 6: Survival by Fare


Filter the data to remove individuals who paid a fare of 0. Make a boxplot of fare grouped by survival status. Try a log2
 transformation of fares. Add the data points with jitter and alpha blending.
Which of the following are true?

Select all correct answers.
1.Passengers who survived generally payed higher fares than those who did not survive.
2.The interquartile range for fares was smaller for passengers who survived.
3.The median fare was lower for passengers who did not survive.
4.Only one individual paid a fare around $500. That individual survived.
5.Most individuals who paid a fare around $8 did not survive.


Answer Code

titanic %>%
    filter(Fare > 0) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Survived, Fare)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2)




 Question 7: Survival by Passenger Class


The Pclass variable corresponds to the passenger class. Make three barplots. For the first, make a basic barplot of 
passenger class filled by survival. For the second, make the same barplot but use the argument position = position_fill()
 to show relative proportions in each group instead of counts. For the third, make a barplot of survival filled by 
passenger class using position = position_fill().

You can read more about making barplots in the textbook section on ggplot2 geometries.
Which of the following are true?

Select all correct answers.
1.There were more third class passengers than passengers in the first two classes combined.
2.There were the fewest passengers in first class, second-most passengers in second class, and most passengers
 in third class.
3.Survival proportion was highest for first class passengers, followed by second class. Third-class had the lowest 
 survival proportion.
4.Most passengers in first class survived. Most passengers in other classes did not survive.
5.The majority of survivors were from first class. (Majority means over 50%.)
6.The majority of those who did not survive were from third class.


Answer Code

# barplot of passenger class filled by survival
titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Pclass, fill = Survived)) +
    geom_bar() +
    ylab("Count")
# barplot of passenger class filled by survival with position_fill
titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Pclass, fill = Survived)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_fill()) +
    ylab("Proportion")
# Barplot of survival filled by passenger class with position_fill
titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Survived, fill = Pclass)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_fill()) +
    ylab("Proportion")


 Question 8: Survival by Age, Sex and Passenger Class

 class.
Which of the following are true?

Select all correct answers.
1.The largest group of passengers was third-class males.
2.The age distribution is the same across passenger classes.
3.The gender distribution is the same across passenger classes.
4.Most first-class and second-class females survived.
5.Almost all second-class males did not survive, with the exception of children.


Answer Code

titanic %>%
    ggplot(aes(Age, y = ..count.., fill = Survived)) +
    geom_density(position = "stack") +
    facet_grid(Sex ~ Pclass)
